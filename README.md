# 💻 LPIC-1 LAB: 103.1 Work on the Command Line

## 🛠️ What I did in this lab
I performed several tasks directly from the terminal. I learned how to work with single-line commands, environment variables, command history, and how to call programs inside and outside of the shell's path. Each step is structured to reinforce command line confidence and precision.

I’ve included some helpful links to guide you through the lab and for studying afterward:

## 📘 What I Learned

This lab strengthened my understanding of the Bash shell environment 👨‍💻.  
I now feel more confident using variables, recalling commands with history, navigating the file system, and invoking commands from inside and outside the shell’s PATH.  
These skills are crucial for scripting and automation tasks I’ll encounter in real-world Linux system administration. 🚀
